myGengo Plugin for Mediawiki
Copyright (C) 2011, see LICENSE

=== Installation
Just unpack the zip into your (mediawiki root)/extenstions directory and add
'require_once("$IP/extensions/mygengo/mygengo.php");'
to your LocalSettings.php.
The extenstion needs two tables in your Mediawiki database. Add them with
mysql -u (mw user) -p (mw database) < (mediawiki)/extensions/mygengo/schema.sql
or use myPhpAdmin and import the schema.sql schema.

=== Configuration
The extension is configured with 3 variables:

$wgMgApiKey        String. Your public API key. You'll find it on you Account page at mygengo.com
$wgMgPrivateKey    String. Your secret key. Can be found in the same place.
$wgMgUsers         Array. Can be used on (semi) public wikis to allow only certian people to submit/administer
                   translation jobs. If the array is empty (the default) everybody has access. 
									 Add usernames to explity whitelist people. This will automaticly pervent everybody else
									 accessing the translation dashboard in Special:MyGengo.
									 ATTENTION: if you use the <dashboard /> tag (see below) blacklisted users will still see your translation jobs
									 but won't be able to view/reject/approve them.

A minimal configuration consits of $wgMgApiKey and $wgMgPrivateKey:

// enable myGengo translation service
require_once("$IP/extensions/mygengo/mygengo.php");
$wgMgApiKey = "<api key>";
$wgMgPrivateKey = "<private key>";

On your myGengo Account page set the 'Default Callback URL' to 'http://<domain>/<mw root>/index.php/Special:MyGengo?page=callback'. Back
on the wiki navigate to 'Special:MyGengo' and click 'Rebuild Database'.

== Translate
The extenstion adds the Special:MyGengoTranslate page to your wiki (look under 'Special Pages'). Here you can
submit translation jobs to myGengo. Or send whole wiki pages by clicking the 'translate' tab.

== Administer
To administer your translation jobs load the Special:MyGengo (w/o ..Translate!) to see the dashboard.
Depending on the status of the job you can review, comment on, view or cancel jobs with the respective links on it.

You can also add the dashboard on other pages with the <dashboard /> tag extension.

Delete the local database of jobs and fetch a fresh one with the 'Rebuild database' link.
Use this sparingly, only if the system somehow desychonized with myGengo!
